    <h3>Instruction 3</h3>
    <p>On the roster my name will come up as Stephen George, I prefer to be called "Bruno." 
        I'm 65 years old, I graduated with an AAT in Web Development from Clark fall 2018. For the past several years, I've been working on an archival project.  Since I've graduated I've resumed its development.
        It's described <a href="https://www.brunogeorge.com/uncategorized/hello-world/">Daisy</a> on my personal site  <a href="https://www.brunogeorge.com/">brunogeorge.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>Instruction 4</h3>
    <p>I wasn't pleased with my comprehension of JavaScript when I took it in spring 2018.  
        This year I decided to audit the course in order to get a fuller comprehension of 
        the fundamentals of JavaScript. When I started at Clark, JavaScript was one of the 
        languages that I most looked forward to learning.  I disappointed myself when, at 
        the end of the quarter, I didn't come out of the class with the skills I hoped to have. </p>
